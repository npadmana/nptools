0. Multi array wrap should give you all the simple type containers you should need.
1. 1D arrays must be Eigen Vectors.
   -- THE ONLY ALLOWED EXCEPTION ARE INDEX LISTS FOR MAs, which must be of type IndexArr.
2. 2D arrays must be either MAs or Eigen Matrices
3. >2D arrays must be MAs.
4. MAs must be passed by value (note : no copying is done)
5. Template specializations for MAs should restrict to MAs.
6. Eigen containers should be passed by reference, or const_reference.
7. Lambdas should ideally always be fitted into a boost::function. Anonymous lambdas are BAD.
8. Prefer functors to free functions for objects returning values. "Procedures" can stay functions.
9. Use STL algorithms *whenever* possible.
10. However, don't obfuscate.
